# Getting Started
## Installing an IDE
Class demonstrations are taught using Visual Studio. To practice programming outside of class you should ensure you have an IDE installed on your home computer/laptop. 

## Using this workbook
Use this workbook in combination with the session slides and notes for full information on everything covered through CodeLab. The chapters and content are ordered in line with the classroom content allowing you to follow along before putting what youâ€™ve learned into practice with the workbook exercises. You should aim to complete these exercises in order as without a firm understanding of previously introduced techniques you may struggle to complete the latter more advanced exercises.

Programming is a difficult skill to master and you will struggle to get to grips with it by coding in the classroom sessions alone. You need to practice coding between classes to ensure you do not get left behind. This workbook should be used to practice both inside and outside of class, allocating yourself time in the week to complete exercises not completed during the class. 2 - 4 hours (or more) of additional practice each week will make a world of difference to your code. A solutions booklet to all exercises is available on StudyLab/Minerva so you can check your answers, or need help if you get stuck. However, do persevere and try to solve the challenges yourself before resorting to the solutions.

## Further Reading & Bonus Exercises
If you have previous programming experience you will find advanced notes with further reading resources, extension problems to the exercises and more advanced bonus exercises in this workbook to push your knowledge. You will also find an additional bonus exercises workbook on StudyLab/Minerva which provide longer programming tasks that can be solved in a variety of ways. Tackle them in any order you wish. Each will require a mixture of the techniques introduced through the workshops so far (selection, loops, arrays, functions, OOP etc). Some of these exercises will take a number of hours / days to complete and are there to help push the boundaries of your C++ knowledge.

   

## Using GitHub
Throughout CodeLab we will be using GitHub to keep track of the code we create. You have been provided with a GitHub repository that includes all the learning materials for CodeLab and is the place where you should save your solutions to the code exercises in this workbook. Your tutor will regularly review the code you post on GitHub in order to provide feedback on your work to help you improve. The more you post to GitHub the more feedback that can be offered.

GitHub will also be used for the submission of assignment code. Guides on using GitHub can be found on StudyLab/Minerva and if you have any questions let your tutor know.
