## Download openFrameworks

Start by downloading openFrameworks from the website. You should select the version labeled osx.

## Unzip the Download

Once the zip file has downloaded extract the contents and save the folder somewhere sensible. For example mine is saved in ```Documents → Dev → C++ → openFrameworks```. Once extracted you might wish to rename the folder. I like to rename mine so I can tell the difference between the public version we have just downloaded from the website and the master version that is available from github (see image below)
