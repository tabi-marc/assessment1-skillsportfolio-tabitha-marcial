# Installing openFrameworks for Visual Studio

This guide is for installing openFrameworks for Visual Studio. The guide is based on Visual Studio 2019, though steps should be the same from earlier versions (2017).

## Download openFrameworks

Start by downloading openFrameworks from the website. You should select the version labeled Visual Studio (2017). This download will also work with visual studio 2019.

## Unzip the Download

Once the zip file has downloaded extract the contents and save the folder somewhere sensible. For example mine is saved in ```Documents → Dev → C++ → openFrameworks```. Once extracted you might wish to rename the folder. I like to rename mine so I can tell the difference between the public version we have just downloaded from the website and the master version that is available from github (see image below)
