# openFrameworks Install Guides

This folder contains guides on how to setup openFrameworks. You will find guides for both Visual Studio (Windows) and Xcode (Mac). These are the main IDEs supported by openFrameworks and it is therefore recommended you use these when working on openFrameworks projects. If you use a Linux machine it is possible to get openFrameworks working though the process is tricker, for a Linux install guide [click here](#https://openframeworks.cc/setup/linux-install/).
