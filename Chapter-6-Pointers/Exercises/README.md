# Chapter 6 - Exercises

Exercises with a tick mark :ballot_box_with_check: represent exercises that must be submitted for *Option 1* of the Programming Skills Portfolio as a minimum expectation. Completing more exercises provides the opportunity to attain higher marks. For each exercise you should create a _**new project**_ with the name of the exercise and save it to this exercises folder in your local repository.

Once you have completed your solution you should make sure you commit and push your solutions to your remote repository on GitHub. You can commit and push as many changes to your solutions as you wish, only those pushed before the chapter deadlines will be marked for the Programming Skills Portfolio.

## Exercise 1 - Whatâ€™s the Point :ballot_box_with_check:

Declare an int variable and assign the value of the int via user input. Next output the following:

* The value of the variable
* The address of the variable
* The value of the variable by dereferencing the pointer

#### Extension Problem (Optional):

Implement an error check mechanism to ensure valid user input (hint: ```cin.fail()``` and loop).

## Exercise 2 - Point to the Max

Write a C++ program to find the max value of an int array. The program will ask the user to input the number of data values in the array followed by entering each value.

The program should then find the max value, assign this value to a pointer variable and output the value by dereferencing the pointer.

## Exercise 3 - Making Memories :ballot_box_with_check:

Write a simple program that allocates memory for an integer variable and string variable. Do the following for both these variables.

* Output the memory address
* Output the value
* Alter the value
* Output the new value
