# assessment1-skillsportfolio-tabitha-marcial
A repository to store C++ solution codes on programming exercises provided by the Code Lab II module. 

# Code-Lab-II-2020-2021
# Module Overview
CodeLab II extends your knowledge of coding to include object-oriented programming (OOP). You build on the procedural programming techniques acquired in CodeLab I to deploy OOP concepts that enhance the functionality and efficiency of your builds.

Through the course of the module you will be introduced to the use of libraries and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to begin developing programmes with Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs). Course content will be delivered through coding exercises and creative briefs that enable you to put newly learnt techniques into practice.

Beyond developing new technical skills, you learn about the software development cycle. Here you form an understanding of how software projects are planned, implemented and maintained in industry. The ultimate aim of CodeLab II is to develop your programming proficiency to the point where you can independently experiment with unfamiliar coding techniques and languages successfully.

The module covers the following themes:

- C++ refresher
- Functions, Conditionals, Control Flow
- Arrays and Vectors
- Pointers
- The STL
- Object Oriented Programming Fundamentals
- Using libraries and frameworks
- Building Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
- Implementing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
- Planning and documenting the software development process
- Repository Contents

# Chapters
These folders contains the chapters of CodeLab II module materials. These chapters should be used in combination with weekly session materials provided on Minerva for full information on everything covered through CodeLab II. The chapters and content are ordered in line with the classroom content allowing you to follow along before putting what youâ€™ve learned into practice with the exercises.

# Chapter Exercises
Each workbook chapter includes exercises to put into practice the techniques you have learned. You should aim to complete these exercises in order as without a firm understanding of previously introduced techniques you may struggle to complete the latter more advanced exercises. Exercises with a tickmark represent exercises that must be submitted as part of Programming Skills Portfolio assessment as a minimum expectation. Completing more exercises provides the opportunity to attain higher marks.

# To complete the exercises:

First make sure you have cloned this repository to your local machine
Create a separate project for each exercise in the corresponding chapter's exercise folder
When happy with your solution commit and push your changes back to Github
Please note that when pushing changes back to Github only the code files will be uploaded, not the Visual Studio. These have been intentionally ignored by a .gitignore file in the root of the repository to keep Github desktop interface and the GitHub repository clutter free. If you need to access a project on a different machine to the one where the project was originally generated, you may need to create a fresh project and copy in the code from the .cpp file, or create a project from existing code. Guides for doing this are provided in the guides folder.

# Guides
Guides on cloning this repository to your machine via GitHub desktop are provided in the guides folder, alongside general information on creating a project in Visual Studio 

# openFrameworks GUIs and APIs
The second half of CodeLab II focuses on working with openFrameworks and APIs to create more advanced graphics based applications. This folder contains information how to get started with openFrameworks, as well as demo projects for a 2D game and Weather App which will be built in class.

# Resources
This folder contains files required for the file handling tasks in chapter 7 as well as some useful code snippets for common C++ tasks.
