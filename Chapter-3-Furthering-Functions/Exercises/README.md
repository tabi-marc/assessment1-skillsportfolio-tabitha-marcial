# Chapter 3 - Exercises

Exercises with a tick mark :ballot_box_with_check: represent exercises that must be submitted for the Programming Skills Portfolio as a minimum expectation. Completing more exercises provides the opportunity to attain higher marks. For each exercise you should create a _**new project**_ with the name of the exercise and save it to this exercises folder in your local repository.

Once you have completed your solution you should make sure you commit and push your solutions to your remote repository on GitHub. You can commit and push as many changes to your solutions as you wish, only those pushed before the chapter deadlines will be marked for the Programming Skills Portfolio.

## Exercise 1 - Sum Function

Write a program that calculates the sum of two values. The program should get the two values from user input and output the results to screen.

You should declare and define your function separately

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Exercise 2 - Double Trouble :ballot_box_with_check:

Write a program that uses a function to double the number passed to it.

* You should pass the variable *by value*.
* The program should output the result of the doubled value *within the function* and the value of the variable passed into the function *after calling the function*.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Exercise 3 - Trouble Doubled :ballot_box_with_check:

Write a program that uses a function to double the number passed to it.

* You should pass the variable *by reference*.
* The program should output the result of the doubled value *within the function* and the value of the variable passed into the function *after calling the function*.

## Exercise 4 - Shape Functions :ballot_box_with_check:

Code a program to display a menu on the screen that asks if the user wants to

```
1: Calculate the area of a square,
2: Calculate the area of a circle,
3: Calculate the area of a triangle.  
```

Each of the 3 functions should ask for the necessary information (e.g. lengths and/or angles and output the answer.

#### Extension Problem (Optional)

Include error handling to prevent the user from entering invalid data.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Exercise 5 - Calculator :ballot_box_with_check:

In chapter 1 you made a simple calculator. Modify this exercise to use functions. The program should display the following calculator menu:

```
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Modulus
```

The program will prompt the user to choose the operation choice (from 1 to 5). Then it asks the user to input values for the calculation. The program outputs the results of the calculation. The program should end by asking if the user would like to perform another calculation or not.

#### Extension Problems (Optional)

* Handle incorrect input
* Add calculations beyond those listed above
* Allow more than two numbers to be calculated
* Allow more than one calculation per set of numbers

## Exercise 6 - Give me the Product

Write a program that passes an array as an argument to a function. The function should then calculate the product (values multiplied) of the array values and return this value back to the main program.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Exercise 7 - Magic 8 Ball

Write a magic 8 ball program. You should allow the user to input a question to which the program will provide a cryptic response. E.g:

```
Q. Shall I go out tonight?
A. Outlook looks good
```

In your solution you should make use of arrays and functions where appropriate
