# Chapter 7 - Exercises

Exercises with a tick mark :ballot_box_with_check: represent exercises that must be submitted for *Option 1* of the Programming Skills Portfolio as a minimum expectation. Completing more exercises provides the opportunity to attain higher marks. For each exercise you should create a _**new project**_ with the name of the exercise and save it to this exercises folder in your local repository.

Once you have completed your solution you should make sure you commit and push your solutions to your remote repository on GitHub. You can commit and push as many changes to your solutions as you wish, only those pushed before the chapter deadlines will be marked for the Programming Skills Portfolio.

## Exercise 1 - What Goes in Must Come Out :ballot_box_with_check:

Using the output file stream create a program that creates a file called “bio.txt” and write the following information to the file:

* Name
* Age
* Hometown

Each piece of data should be on a new line

Once the data has been written, create an input file stream and output the data just entered by reading from the file.

## Exercise 2 - Counting is Fun :ballot_box_with_check:

Using the file ```randomStrings.txt``` write a program that outputs the total number of lines in the program.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Exercise 3 - Reading to an Array (A)

The file ```numbersA.txt```  has a list of 100 integer numbers each on a newline. Create a program that puts this data into an array, then output the values.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Exercise 4 - Reading to an Array (B)

The file ```numbersB.txt```  has a list of 100 integer numbers each the same line, separated by a ‘|’ character. Create a program that puts this data into an array, then output the values.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Exercise 5 - Comparing Strings

The file ```sentences.txt``` has a list of string data. Create a program that finds out how many times the following sentence appears “Hello my name is Jake Hobbs”

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Exercise 6 - The Petrol Pump :ballot_box_with_check:

Every time a motorist buys some petrol, he notes the number of litres bought and the amount paid per litre. This data can be found in the ```petrolPump.txt``` file in your GitHub repository. The data is stored in columns separated by a tabbed space, like the following sample:

```
No Litres   Cost 	
19          60.2
4.5         61.3
22          60.1
23          50
12          12.0000
22          76
18          69.9
17          70
```

Write a program that calculates:

* What was the overall average price per litre of petrol bought?
* How much petrol in litres was bought at under 48p per litre?
